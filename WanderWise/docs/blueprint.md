## Original User Request:
React native Mobile application for ios and andoird.  A travel itenary app. User can say where they are going and staying, how many people they are going, what type of activities they want, what type of group they are (family, friends, collegue etc etc) and also for how many days, and then by using an ai platform api ( use deepseek api for this) , the ai will showcase very detailed and comprehensive iterary for their trip. They can then save it. Because they should be able to save it, they are gonna need to make their own accounts. The layout needs to be minimal and clean. Since we have accounts and the person should be able to save their itenerary or even share it we are gonna need backend and database. Use firebase as databas and show me how to configure my firebase console config to match the app you have made.
